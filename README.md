# damping_in_alloy_MD
to explore the damping behavior in alloys by molecular dyanmics

This project is based on my Master's Thesis. MD is implemented to explore how the damping property of TiNi controled by microstructure, temperature.
Supporting material and simulation data will be uploaded after graduation.

The majority of this work was based on Lammps, also ATOMSK and OVITO were used for pre- and postprocess.
